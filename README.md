## Business Problem & Project Objective

Hospital management requires a data-driven understanding of daily operations and financial performance in order to support informed decision-making and resource planning.

The objective of this project is to analyze hospital operational and financial data using SQL to uncover actionable insights across four key business dimensions:

- **Operational efficiency of doctors and appointments**  
  Evaluate doctor workload, appointment distribution, and utilization patterns to identify potential inefficiencies and capacity imbalances.

- **Revenue drivers and cost distribution**  
  Analyze revenue generation across doctors, medical specializations, and treatment types to determine key revenue contributors and financial concentration risks.

- **Patient behavior patterns**  
  Examine patient visit frequency, spending behavior, and engagement trends to identify high-impact patient segments and recurring usage patterns.

- **Workload imbalance and growth trends**  
  Assess temporal trends in appointments and revenue to detect growth, seasonality, and workload disparities over time.

By translating raw transactional data into structured KPIs and analytical insights, this project demonstrates the practical application of SQL for real-world healthcare analytics and business intelligence use cases.
